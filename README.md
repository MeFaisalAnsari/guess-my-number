# Guess My Number - JavaScript Game

GuessMyNumber is a game which is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a small JavaScript project for beginners.

## About this Game

This is a guessing game in which the user has to guess the correct number between 1 and 20 (including both).

Initially the score is 20 and as you guess the wrong number, the score gets reduced by 1. Upon successful guessing, the window will turn green and the current score will be added to highscore. The user can play this game again (by clicking on 'Again!' button) and if the score is greater than the high score, then high score will get updated.

If the user can't guess the right number in 20 attempts, then he will lose and the window will turn red.
